  Video Search App

## Introduction

This is a YouTube browser app. Users can search YouTube videos and a matching list is returned. I completed this project as part of a React training course I completed.

### Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) v16.13.1
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) v0.20.0
- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

Install the dependecies

```sh
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file and include your API key:

```sh
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your_API_Key>
```

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
